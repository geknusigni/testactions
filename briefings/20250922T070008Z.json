He added, “I hate to tell you this, but a man named Lachlan is involved,” clarifying that he was referring to Lachlan Murdoch. “Rupert [Murdoch] is probably gonna be in the group, I think they’re gonna be in the group,” Trump said.</p>\n\n<p>A person familiar with the matter said that if an investment does take place, it would be from Fox Corporation, which the Murdochs oversee.</p>\n\n<p>A deal to sell TikTok’s U.S. business has been in the works for months but appeared to accelerate this weekend after Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping approved the deal during a phone call between the pair on Friday.</p>",

Rent the Runway is in the middle of a turnaround plan to cut its costs and restart subscriber growth after COVID lockdowns decimated demand for office and event attire.</p>\n\n<p>“The thing holding Rent the Runway back over the past few years has been our capital structure,” cofounder and CEO Jenn Hyman said in an interview on The Information’s TITV earlier this week. “Both our lender as well as our private equity firms believed that there was actually value in continuing to be a public stock and enabling public shareholders to be along for the value creation ride. They did a year of work on the business and understanding it, researching the business, and they believed that the business was vastly misunderstood by the public markets,” she added.</p>",

We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal.” Trump also said he had agreed to visit China “in the early part of next year.”</p>\n\n<p>China’s Xinhua news agency put out a statement saying the Chinese government, in respect to TikTok, “is pleased to see companies engage in sound commercial negotiations based on market principles, aiming to reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and achieve a balance of interests. It hopes the U.S. side will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises investing in the United States.”</p>\n\n<p>Under the deal, TikTok parent company ByteDance will sell TikTok U.S. to a company 80% owned by U.S. investors, including several shareholders that&nbsp;own stock in ByteDance,&nbsp;while ByteDance will take a&nbsp;19.9% stake.</p>\n\n<p>The investors will pay a&nbsp;fee to the U.S. government that could total in the billions of dollars for arranging the spinoff, according to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/u-s-government-expected-to-get-multibillion-dollar-fee-in-tiktok-deal-685e3944?mod=hp_lead_pos2\">The Wall Street Journal</a>.

At the time, Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-data-center-spending-isnt-falling-despite-reports-of-cancelled-leases?rc=geicgp\">rebutted reports from media and analysts</a> that the pause was indicative of a broader slowdown in data center spending. The company spent nearly $90 billion on capital expenditures in the year ending in June, blowing past its own projection for that period, and said that its capex will rise in the coming year.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft has said repeatedly that AI customers’ demand for servers is outpacing its supply. OpenAI, Microsoft’s biggest cloud customer, recently signed a deal to spend more than $300 billion on Oracle servers in the coming years after complaining that Microsoft wasn’t moving fast enough to provide data center capacity.</p>",

The news sent Intel’s stock soaring 29%.</p>\n\n<p>The deal strengthens the prospects for Intel, which had been flailing in recent months as it struggles to catch up to chip design rivals such as Nvidia and to chip manufacturers like TSMC. Intel, known for its central processing units, will now count Nvidia as a major customer.</p>\n\n<p>CPUs are widely used in data centers for various types of computing, but they are also needed alongside Nvidia’s AI chips. Nvidia currently uses chip designer Arm’s architecture for its CPUs. This new deal will give Intel a piece of that business. On a call with reporters, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said a large portion of cloud providers and enterprises still use Intel’s architecture, known as x86, in their data centers, rather than Arm-based chips. The collaboration will give Nvidia a chance of selling more sophisticated AI systems to those customers. Nvidia would join the U.S. government, which recently took a 10% stake in Intel. Nvidia is likely to have a stake of around 3.6%, based on Intel’s market capitalization of Thursday of $140 billion. Huang declined to comment on whether Nvidia separately plans to manufacture any of its AI chips at Intel’s chip foundry.</p>",

In his memorandum opinion, Mehta said that Google had to stop exclusive search distribution contracts and required some data sharing with search engine rivals, but didn’t require it to divest Chrome or stop search distribution payments altogether, as plaintiffs led by the Department of Justice had requested.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, the two parties filed competing proposed final judgments—together totaling nearly 200 pages—in which each side argued that the other was twisting Mehta’s ruling. The Justice Department, for example, argued that Google’s proposal would allow the company to require phone manufacturers to include Google Search on home screens or condition installing YouTube or Google Maps on exclusive distribution of Google’s Gemini assistant. The agency argued that Mehta’s ruling prohibits both types of agreements.</p>\n\n<p>Google, meanwhile, argued for example that the Justice Department’s definition of a generative AI product as covered by the ruling is too broad and that the plaintiffs would force Google to share data with too many other companies.</p>\n\n<p>The discrepancies in the two parties’ proposed final judgments signal how much work Mehta still has ahead of him to determine how exactly Google must change its behavior. Mehta will next issue a final judgment, at which point the parties have the option to appeal the case. Google has already said it will appeal the judge’s initial liability finding that it had an illegal search monopoly, whereas the Department of Justice said after Mehta’s remedies ruling earlier this month that it was exploring its options.</p>",
